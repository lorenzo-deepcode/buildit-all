# Bookit Iteration #6: Demo Plan

Demo date: Wednesday June 7, 2017

1) Admin user management: UI only


## Admin functionality

We intend to demonstrate three parts of the user management functionality. (Note that these features are only built out in the UI and are not yet connected to Bookit server or a real Microsoft service.)

As a Bookit admin, I want to see all users that have access to Bookit.
1) Log in as Rasmus, who is a user with administrative privileges.
2) See an "Admin" link in the upper right. Click it.
3) See an Admin view, which opens to a list of current users organized by team. Click on "Buildit" and see Buildit users. Click on "Designit" and see Designit users.
4) Search for a user by name and see the list reduce to show only that user.
5) See a list of recently added users in the left panel.

As a Bookit admin, I want to be able to delete a user so only approved employees can book rooms
1) On the Admin view, see the list of users. Hover over a user and see a "Remove" button. Click "Remove". 
2) See a confirmation dialog. Click "Yes".
3) See a message confirming that the user was removed.
4) The user no longer appears in the list.
