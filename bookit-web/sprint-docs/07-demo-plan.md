# Bookit Iteration #7: Demo Plan

Demo date: Wednesday June 14, 2017

1) Admin user management: UI only

## Admin functionality

We intend to demonstrate three parts of the user management functionality. (Note that these features are only built out in the UI and are not yet connected to Bookit server or a real Microsoft service.)

As a Bookit admin, I want to invite new users so that people can use bookit.
1) On the Admin view, click the plus button.
2) See an Invite User form.
3) Fill out the form. Click "Send Invite".
4) See a confirmation that the invitation was sent.
5) See the user appear in the list, marked as not having accepted the invitation yet.
