# aws-cloudwatch-events-eg
Example project for setting up a CloudWatch Event rule using CloudFormation.  The rule can optionally be bound to an
externally-defined Lambda function for processing.

This was one path we considered when implementing the solution found in buildit/aws-monitoring and is left here as an
example of a different approach.
