# Buildit

Not a consultancy, not an outsourcer. Buildit is a transformation partner that participates. We build software, we build teams, we build new ways of working, we build new organisations.

Technology moves, the competition moves, the market moves, the people move. We are here because we enjoy that complexity, we believe that success requires autonomy, and we know that autonomy rocks.

The future belongs to those who understand that itâ€™s not about system specification but end-user expectation. The future belongs to those who design and build it. The future belongs to those who make it.
