## The hiring process

We want to have a simple process that will allow both us and you to bring out the best of all parties. We want to make
sure that we are right for you as much as the other way around. The _typical_ hiring process is as follows:

### Stage 1: Let's chat (permanent roles only)

A chat on the phone or a video call, where we talk a bit about us and how your experiences can help us.

### Stage 2: Tech exercise

Here we would like to see a little bit of your tech and coding skills. You can find the tech exercise under
Exercises. Just pick the one you feel the best about and show us some awesome code. Your solution will be used in
the next stage to build upon during a pairing session with a couple of our engineers.

### Stage 3: Meet the team

This involves a visit to one of our offices where you get to meet a few of the team. We'll get to talk
in more detail about what we do, your experiences, ambitions and how you can help us grow and build awesome software.
Amongst things we will also spend a bit of time talking about your tech submission and we will pair program building a
few more features.

### Stage 4: That's it

That's it pretty much it. There will be one more phone call with HR over some admin matters and possible start dates.
Welcome to Buildit!

### Feedback

We will provide feedback within 24 hours of all stages. In the meantime, if you have any feedback on the process we
would be very keen to hear it. We are constantly looking for ways to improve and refine how we work so would love to
hear what your side of the story is, good or bad.
