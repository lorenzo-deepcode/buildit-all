## Requirements

Please write a simple web crawler in a language of your choice in a couple of hours – please don’t spend much more than that.

The crawler should be limited to one domain. Given a starting URL – say http://wiprodigital.com - it should visit all pages within the domain, but not follow the links to external sites such as Google or Twitter.

The output should be a simple structured site map (this does not need to be a traditional XML sitemap - just some sort of output to reflect what your crawler has discovered), showing links to other pages under the same domain, links to external URLs and links to static content such as images for each respective page.

Please provide a README.md file that explains how to run / build your solution. Also, detail anything further that you would like to achieve with more time. 

Once done, please make your solution available on Github and forward the link. Where possible please include your commit history to give visibility of your thinking and progress.

## What we are looking for

This exercise is to examine your technical knowledge, reasoning and engineering principals. There are no tricks or hidden agendas. 

We are looking for a demonstration of your experience and skill using current software development technologies and methodologies. Please make sure your code is clear and demonstrates good practices. 

Your solution will form the basis for discussion in subsequent interviews.

## Checklist

Please **ensure** you have submitted the following:

1. Working crawler **as per requirements above**
2. A README.md explaining
  - How to build and run your solution
  - Reasoning and describe any trade offs
  - Explanation of what could be done with more time
3. Project builds / runs / tests as per instruction

**Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your creation**
