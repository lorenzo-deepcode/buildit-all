## Requirements

Please build an app displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice.

1. Do not spend more than 4 hours on your solution **(even if you do not complete the entire exercise)**.
2. Build a native iOS or Android app (your choice).
3. Use the [OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve the current 5 day weather forecast.
4. Give some thought to what will make a decent user experience. We would like to see something readable but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI elements.
5. Use any supporting technologies, package managers, build systems, component libraries that you are familiar with and feel are appropriate.
6. Provide a README.md file that:
  - Documents how to run / build / test your creation.
  - Documents anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt, corrections etc).
7. **The solution should be able to run locally with the appropriate simulator**.
8. Submit your code on a **public git repository** of your choice (github / bitbucket etc).

## What we are looking for

This exercise is to examine your technical knowledge, reasoning and engineering principles. There are no tricks or hidden agendas. We are looking for a demonstration of your experience and skill using current software development technologies and methodologies. Please make sure your code is clear, demonstrates good practices and that the README.md file explains how to run / build your solution. Also, detail anything further that you would like to achieve with more time. Your solution will form the basis for discussion in subsequent interviews.

## Checklist

Please **ensure** you have submitted the following:

1. Working forecast app **as per requirements**
2. Clear instructions of where the solution is hosted
3. A README.md explaining
  - How to run / build / test project
  - What could be done with more time
4. Project builds / runs / tests as per instructions

Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your creation.
