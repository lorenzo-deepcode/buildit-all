## Microbits Totem Project

*TODO - About the project*

### Getting started

Please make sure you are using NodeJS 6.11+. Node 8 works best.

First run:

```
npm install
```

Then

```
npm start
```

That will setup a nodemon watcher on your filesystem for dev work.

If you just want to run a build, then run

```
npm run build
```

Once the bundle has been built, you can then run the app through Evothings Studio.

### Firebase config

Please add the relevant firebase config to your .bashrc or your .zshrc.

```
export API_KEY=
export AUTH_DOMAIN=
export DATABASE_URL=
export PROJECT_ID=
export STORAGE_BUCKET=
export MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
```
