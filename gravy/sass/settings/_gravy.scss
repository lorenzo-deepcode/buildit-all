/// base initialisation map for gravy, following an explanation of each single root-level key.
///
/// This is basically an aggregation of configuration maps used by several different libraries.
/// It will create the actual maps that will be then used at runtime through some mixins.
/// Some of this configuration is mandatory, the rest can be omitted as some sensible defaults are provided.
///
/// ## Typefaces
///
/// Allows you to use the mixin [`gravy-font()`](#mixin-gravy-font).
///
/// ```scss
/// typefaces: (
///   name: (
///     stack: ('fontface1', 'fontface2'),
///     weights: (
///       light: 300,
///       regular: 400,
///       medium: 500,
///       bold: 600
///     )
///   )
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Allows you to do the following:
///
/// ```scss
///   @include gravy-font('name', 'medium');
/// ```
///
/// ## Breakpoints
///
/// Allows to store and access easily breakpoint sizes in whichever format you want using [`gravy-breakpoint()`](#function-gravy-breakpoint).
/// Few grid frameworks use this map already.
///
/// ```scss
/// breakpoints: (
///   namedsize: 1024px
/// )
/// ```
///
/// You can then access them with the following:
///
/// ```scss
///   @include gravy-breakpoint('namedsize');
/// ```
///
/// ## Typi
///
/// Please refer to [Typi](https://github.com/zellwk/typi) for information on how to correctly configure this variable.
/// You will need to use the name of the breakpoints defined in the `breakpoints` map when definining every single responsive font sizing definition.
/// In its essence this map is organised as follows:
///
/// ```scss
/// breakpoints: (
///   breakpoint1: 600px,
///   breakpoint2: 1200px
/// )
/// typi: (
///   base: (
///     null: (font-size, line-height),
///     breakpoint1: (font-size-1, line-height-1),
///     breakpoint2: (font-size-2, line-height-2)
///   )
///   name1: (
///     null: (font-size-3, line-height-3),
///     breakpoint1: (font-size-4, line-height-4),
///     breakpoint2: (font-size-5, line-height-5)
///   ),
///   name2: (
///     null: (font-size-4, line-height-4),
///     breakpoint1: (font-size-5, line-height-5),
///     breakpoint2: (font-size-6, line-height-6)
///   )
/// )
/// ```
///
/// This way you can call typi in the following way:
///
/// ```scss
///   @include typi('name2');
/// ```
///
/// which will generate all the necessary font-sizes and breakpoints
///
