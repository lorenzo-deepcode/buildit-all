# DeleteVersionedS3Bucket
Deletes a versioned S3 Bucket using the credentials on the user's computer

Taken from http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-or-empty-bucket.html#delete-bucket-sdk-java and modified slightly to warn the user that the bucket does not exist but not to throw an error.
