# Pattern Lab (Node) edition that uses the Twig engine

This package is a [Pattern Lab Edition](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html) for projects wanting to use:

* The **Node** version of **Pattern Lab**
* **Twig** for pattern templates and/or starter kits (instead of the default Mustache)
* **Gulp** for running build tasks
* **SASS** for generating CSS

It is loosely based on (and has grabbed chunks of code from) the official [Pattern Lab Node Gulp Edition](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp). Kudos to those folks!


## Purpose

The intent of this edition (and any Pattern Lab editions in general) is to **help get your style guide projects up and running quickly**. The edition itself provides the basic scaffolding (the folder structure and config for Pattern Lab, a ready-made Gulp build, etc.). It also includes Gulp tasks for quickly installing pre-made starter kits that give you an initial set of pattern templates and assets to start working from.


## Usage
