/**
 * Provides programatic access to CSS, asset and SASS file paths
 * that are published by the gravity-ui-sass NPM package.
 *
 * This is so that consumers of this package can access those files
 * in their own build processes (e.g. to copy them to their build dir)
 * without needing to know the internal directory structure of this
 * package or having to hard-code file paths in their own build
 * scripts.
 *
 * Note, since this file is included in the published NPM package, it
 * must not export paths or filenames that are excluded from the published
 * package. Refer to the 'files' section in package.json to see exactly
 * what gets published and what does not.
 *
 * Any path or file data that is required for development and builds but
 * is excluded from the published NPM package should be added to
 * gulp/paths.js instead of this file.
