## Purpose

This is a variation of the main Page Header component, where the Buildit logo is marked up as the level 1 heading of the page, rather than being a link. This intended for the use exclusively on the homepage of a website, becuase:

* It is redundant for a page to link to itself (on other pages, the logo typically links to the homepage)
* The "buildit @ wipro digital" title text of the logo SVG is a suitable H1 heading text for the homepage
