## Purpose

This is the main Page Footer that sits below every page. It contains some additional links to privacy, accessibility statements and some additional useful information.

When using this component, make sure the following restrictions are enforced:

* The Page Footer _should_ be the last component on the template/page
* There **must** only be 1 instance of a Page Footer on a template/page

The Page Footer is identified by its ARIA attrbute `role="contentinfo"`, which may be used by assistive technologies. Since this ARIA role cannot be used for anything else, adding a class name to the Page Footer component would be redundant.
