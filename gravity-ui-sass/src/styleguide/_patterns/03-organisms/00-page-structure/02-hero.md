## Purpose

The Hero is a coloured block that displays some copy in an attractive way.

It's not meant to contain a lot of copy, rather a few and well addressed information.

It's usually presented with a background image at larger sizes. The image is set in a `style` attribute in the hero container, which allows a bit of dynamicity in the way it works. The image should be in grayscale to allow the colour blend method to work accordingly. The image and the way it will display should be tested for inclusivity.

The content of the hero is going to be well distanced against each other.

### TODO

Move the `background-image` in the class and expose it as a CSS variable to allow costumisation from the client.
