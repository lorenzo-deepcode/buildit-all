##Â Purpose

This is a very simple ordered list with a very custom look and feel. It has been concieved to represent steps of a process.

On smaller screens it appears as a numbered list, with custom numbering (each number is prefixed by the word "Step") and a dashed line connecting each of them.

On larger screen each item of the list will place itself on left and right alternatively and maintain the steps and dashed line in the middle.

## Notes and TODOs

This list won't work well with just a single line next to the step number, as it benefits from a bit of distance between each step.
