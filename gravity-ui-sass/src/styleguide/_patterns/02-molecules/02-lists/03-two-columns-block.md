##Â Purpose

This is a generic component that can be used to display a list of objects in two columns. It doesn't necessarely need to be using a `<ul>` `<li>` combo, as it's been generically written, as the example should show.

If the number of items in the list are odd, the last one will be placed in the centre of the last row.
