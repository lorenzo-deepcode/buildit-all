## Purpose

Represents a non-nested list of links to sections within the website or application. Typically used within the page header for the primary navigation.

The entry that corresponds to the current page or section, is highlighted visually and is not clickable (since it would just be a pointless link to the current page).

The number of links in the menu and the length of each link's label text is completely arbitrary. The nav menu component will fill the width of its parent element, but its height will be variable. On narrow viewports, the menu's links are laid out as a vertical list. On wider viewports, they are laid out horizontally, wrapping over multiple rows if needed to accommodate all the links.

Designs must therefore not make any assumptions about the overall size of this UI element.
