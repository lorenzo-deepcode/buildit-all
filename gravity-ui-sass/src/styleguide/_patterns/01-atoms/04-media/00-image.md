## Purpose

The `<img>` element represents an image.

Except where otherwise specified, the `alt` attribute must be specified and its value must not be empty; the value must be an appropriate replacement for the image. The most general rule to consider when writing alternative text is the following: the intent is that replacing every image with the text of its `alt` attribute not change the meaning of the page.

A corollary to this is that the alt attribute's value should never contain text that could be considered the image's caption, title, or legend. It is supposed to contain replacement text that could be used by users instead of the image; it is not meant to supplement the image. The title attribute can be used for supplemental information.
