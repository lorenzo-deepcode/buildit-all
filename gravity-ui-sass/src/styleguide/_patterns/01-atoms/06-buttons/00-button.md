## Purpose

The `<button>` element represents a button labeled by its contents.

The `type` attribute controls the behavior of the button when it is activated. It is an enumerated attribute.

* `submit`: Submits the form (default, if `type` is not specified)
* `button`: Does nothing
* `reset`: Resets the form

Note, you can nest an icon within a button (only supported on `<button>` elements, not `<input type="button">`). If your button _only_ contains an icon, then you must use the Icon Button component instead.
