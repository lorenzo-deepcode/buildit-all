## Purpose

Icon Toggle Buttons are for scenarios where a toggle button _only_ contains an icon, and not any text. They ensure that the button is styled correctly (equal padding on all sides) and, more importantly, that a text alternative for the button's icon is correctly set via the `aria-label` attribute.
