## Purpose

Nav Links have a simplified style (similar to body copy) along with extra padding. This increases the clickable area, making them easier to click or tap.

They are to be used within navigation menus only.

The placeholder variant (where, the `href` attribute is absent), has a visually distinct style. This is for use within navigation menus, where a placeholder link is used to indicate the current page or section.
