## Purpose

The table element represents data with more than one dimension, in the form of a table.

Authors are encouraged to provide information describing how to interpret complex tables.

Tables must **not** be used as layout aids. Historically, some Web authors have misused tables in HTML as a way to control their page layout. This usage is non-conforming, because tools attempting to extract tabular data from such documents would obtain very confusing results. In particular, users of accessibility tools like screen readers are likely to find it very difficult to navigate pages with tables used for layout.
