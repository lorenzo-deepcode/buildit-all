## Purpose

The `<q>` element represents some phrasing content quoted from another source.

Quotation punctuation (such as quotation marks) that is quoting the contents of the element must not appear immediately before, after, or inside `<q>` elements; they will be inserted into the rendering by the user agent.

Content inside a `<q>` element must be quoted from another source, whose address, if it has one, may be cited in the `cite` attribute. The source may be fictional, as when quoting characters in a novel or screenplay. If the `cite` attribute is present, it must be a valid URL potentially surrounded by spaces.
