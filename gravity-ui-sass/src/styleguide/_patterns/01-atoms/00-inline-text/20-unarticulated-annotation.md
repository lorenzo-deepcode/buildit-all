## Purpose

The `<u>` element represents a span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as being misspelt.

In most cases, another element is likely to be more appropriate: for marking stress emphasis, the [`<em>` element](em) should be used; for marking key words or phrases either the [`<b>` element](b) or the [`<mark>` element](mark) should be used, depending on the context; for marking book titles, the [`<cite>` element](cite) should be used; for labeling text with explicit textual annotations, the [`<ruby>` element](ruby) should be used; for technical terms, taxonomic designation, transliteration, a thought, or for labeling ship names in Western texts, the [`<i>` element](i) should be used.
