## Purpose

The `<abbr>` element represents an abbreviation or acronym, optionally with its expansion. The `title` attribute may be used to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. The attribute, if specified, must contain an expansion of the abbreviation, and nothing else.

Providing an expansion in a `title` attribute once will not necessarily cause other `<abbr>` elements in the same document with the same contents but without a `title` attribute to behave as if they had the same expansion. Every `<abbr>` element is independent.
