## Purpose

The `<kbd>` element represents user input (typically keyboard input, although it may also be used to represent other input, such as voice commands).

* When the `<kbd>` element is nested inside a [`<samp>`](samp) element, it represents the input as it was echoed by the system.
* When the `<kbd>` element contains a `<samp>` element, it represents input based on system output, for example invoking a menu item.
* When the `<kbd>` element is nested inside another `<kbd>` element, it represents an actual key or other single unit of input as appropriate for the input mechanism.
