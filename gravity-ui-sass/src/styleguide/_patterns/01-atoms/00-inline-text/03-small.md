## Purpose

The `<small>` element represents side comments such as small print.

The small element should not be used for extended spans of text, such as multiple paragraphs, lists, or sections of text. It is only intended for short runs of text. The text of a page listing terms of use, for instance, would not be a suitable candidate for the small element: in such a case, the text is not a side comment, it is the main content of the page.

The small element must not be used for subheadings; for that purpose, use the `<hgroup>` element.
