## Purpose

The `<time>` element represents times, dates or durations along with a machine-readable form.

The machine-readable time data can be provided either as the content of the `<time>` element or, if the content is not machine-readable, via the `datetime` attribute.

Refer to the HTML5 spec for the [supported datetime value syntaxes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#datetime-value).
