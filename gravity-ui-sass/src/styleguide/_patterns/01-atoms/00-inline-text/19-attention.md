## Purpose

The `<b>` element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.

The `<b>` element should be used as a last resort when no other element is more appropriate. In particular, headings should use the [`<h1>`](h1) to `<h6>` elements, stress emphasis should use the [`<em>` element](em), importance should be denoted with the [`<strong>` element](em), and text marked or highlighted should use the [`<mark>` element](mark).
