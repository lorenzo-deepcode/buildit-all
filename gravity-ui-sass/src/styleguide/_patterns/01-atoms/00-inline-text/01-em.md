## Purpose

The `<em>` element represents **stress emphasis** of text. Although browsers will typically render this as italicised text (unless the CSS overrides this), it should not be used if the _reason_ you want italicised text is something other than stress emphasis. For other situations, such has highlighting a different mood or voice, the [`<i>`](i) element is more appropriate.
