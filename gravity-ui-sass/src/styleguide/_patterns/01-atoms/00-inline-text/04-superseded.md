## Purpose

The `<s>` element represents contents that are no longer accurate or no longer relevant. For example, a recommended retail price that has been replaced by a special offer.

The `<s>` element is not appropriate when indicating document edits; to mark a span of text as having been removed from a document, use the [`<del>`](del) element.
