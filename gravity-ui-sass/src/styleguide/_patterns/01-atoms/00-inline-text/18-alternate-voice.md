## Purpose

The `<i>` element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, transliteration, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.

Terms in languages different from the main text should be annotated with `lang` attributes.

Authors are encouraged to consider whether other elements might be more applicable than the `<i>` element, for instance the [`<em>`](em) element for marking up stress emphasis, or the [`<dfn>`](dfn) element to mark up the defining instance of a term.
