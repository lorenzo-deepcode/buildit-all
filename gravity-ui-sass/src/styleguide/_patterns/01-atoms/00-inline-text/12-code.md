## Purpose

The `<code>` element represents a fragment of computer code. This could be an XML element name, a file name, a computer program, or any other string that a computer would recognise.

There is no formal way to indicate the language of computer code being marked up. Authors who wish to mark code elements with the language used, e.g. so that syntax highlighting scripts can use the right rules, can use the `class` attribute, e.g. by adding a class prefixed with "language-" to the element.
