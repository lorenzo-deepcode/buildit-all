## Usage

The `<dl>` element represents an association list consisting of zero or more name-value groups (a description list).

Name-value groups may be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers, or any other groups of name-value data. The values within a group are alternatives; multiple paragraphs forming part of the same value must all be given within the same dd element.

The order of the list of groups, and of the names and values within each group, may be significant.
