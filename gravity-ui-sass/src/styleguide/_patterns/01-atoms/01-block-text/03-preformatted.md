## Usage

The `<pre>` element represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements. Cases where `<pre>` can be used include:

* Including an e-mail, with paragraphs indicated by blank lines, lists indicated by lines prefixed with a bullet, and so on.
* Including fragments of computer code, with structure indicated according to the conventions of that language.
    * To represent a block of computer code, the `<pre>` element can be used with a `<code>` element; to represent a block of computer output the `<pre>` element can be used with a `<samp>` element. Similarly, the `<kbd>` element can be used within a `<pre>` element to indicate text that the user is to enter.
* Displaying ASCII art.
