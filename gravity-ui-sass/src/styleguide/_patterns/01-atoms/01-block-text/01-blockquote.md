## Usage

The `<blockquote>` element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a footer or cite element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

Note, the [WHATWG HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element) forbids embedding the citation _within_ the `<blockquote>` element. However, this has been contested and in their latest drafts the W3C do permit citations to reside within the `<blockquote>`, as long as they are inside a `<footer>` or `<cite>` element.
