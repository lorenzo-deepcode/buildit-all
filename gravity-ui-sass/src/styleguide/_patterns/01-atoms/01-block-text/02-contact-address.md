## Usage

The `<address>` element represents the contact information for its nearest `<article>` or `<body>` element ancestor. If that is the `<body>` element, then the contact information applies to the document as a whole.

The `<address>` element must not be used to represent arbitrary addresses (e.g. postal addresses), unless those addresses are in fact the relevant contact information. (The `<p>` element is the appropriate element for marking up postal addresses in general.) The `<address>` element must not contain information other than contact information.
