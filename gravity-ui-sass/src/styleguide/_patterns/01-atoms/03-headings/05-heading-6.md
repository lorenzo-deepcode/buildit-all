## Purpose

Level 6 headings (`<h6>`) are used if any sections headed by a level 5 heading need to be further sub-divided. This is the lowest rank of heading that HTML provides. Unless you have a very long and complex body of text level 6 headings should be a rare occurrence. Even in that event, it may be worth considering splitting your content across multiple pages rather than making one, massive one.
