## Purpose

Level 5 headings (`<h5>`) are used if any sections headed by a level 4 heading need to be further sub-divided. Unless you have a very long and complex body of text level 5 headings should be a rare occurrence. Even in that event, it may be worth considering splitting your content across multiple pages rather than making one, massive one.
