## Purpose

This is a standardised set of inset values to use for padding on UI elements. These are derived from the spacing scale.

There are two kinds of insets:

* **Normal**: Use the same space value on all 4 sides.
* **Squished**: Use a smaller space value for top and bottom sides, than the one they use for left and right.
