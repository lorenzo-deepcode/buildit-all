## Purpose

Just as we restrict ourselves to a finite set of colours and typography styles, we do the same for spacing lenghts. This promotes consistency and reuse throughout our UI designs.

Similar to the typographic scales, our spacing scale is calculated by taking a base size and repeatedly multiplying or dividing it by the same factor to get large or smaller sizes in the scale respectively.

The available, pre-calculated sizes are shown here. Only the corresponding SASS variables should be used when setting CSS property values.
